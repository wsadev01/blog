(De forma estructurada)\nIntro\nHacer dotfiles es un trabajo arduo en un inicio, pero luego es una práctica que no puede faltar.\nHay muchas formas, yo utilizo un .git en mi home, donde excluyo todo en el .gitignore e incluyo\nespecíficamente lo que me interesa utilizando el parametro -f del comando git add.\nComandos útiles\nComandoUtilidad\npacman -Qqent &gt; native.txtGuardá los paquetes oficiales que instalaste (Excluye los q son dependencias)\npacman -Qqemt &gt; foreign.txtGuardá los paquetes no-oficiales (AUR) que instalaste (Excluye los q son dependencias)\npacman -Sy - &lt; &lt;(curl $URL_DEL_TXT)Instalá los paquetes desde un .txt en internet\ncurl $URL_DEL_BASH|bashEjecuta un script de un .bash de internet\n\nBitácora\n01/06/2024 - 22:29\nCreí que iba a ser mucho mas rápido, pero tal vez ni un fin de semana me alcance, especialmente la parte de la re-configuración de terminales,\nya que me pasé a UXTerm debido a que voy a usar tmux para todo lo referido a Tabs y coso...\n01/06/2024 - 23:33\nMe pasé a rxvt-unicode al final (URxvt), cambié el theme a gruvbox-material (dark).\n01/06/2024 - 23:44\nTerminé de configurar el urxvt, también refactoricé algunas configuraciónes de nvim. (El lualine y el theme.lua)\n02/06/2024 - 00:09\nMe quedé jugando unas partiditas de lichess... seguimos con los paquetes, diferenciando AUR de los oficiales.\n02/06/2024 - 00:46\nCon bastante sueño ya, estoy con esto desde hoy temprano pero arranqué a \"bitacorear\" ahora, me sirve para\nconcentrarme y para llevar un registro de mis propios pasos, y bueno, si algun gordo nerd le interesa leer esto.\nYa terminé de acomodar los paquetes en native (Oficiales) y foreign.txt (AUR), ahora voy por un script que sea install.sh.\nAntes quería automatizar el particionado de discos, ahora realmente prefiero hacer esa parte a mano, y el post-install automático. Creo que es lo mas rápido y lo más directo tbh.\n02/06/2024 - 01:03\nLo único malo de urxvt es que con nvim no puedo abrir links. Ahora vamos a subir todo esto y acomodar 2\npájaros de un tiro, mi blog en github, y los static files que sirven a la instalación de mis dotfiles\n02/06/2024 - 03:25\nEstá quedando bien, y con un estilo que representa muy bien mi personalidad, me voy a dormir, hacia bastante\nno usaba CSS.\n02/06/2024 - 13:10\nMe re dormí, pero ya me desperté frente a la pc me senté, el desayuno ya tomé el correo RSS checaré....\nMe hice unos buenos mates, y a seguir.\n02/06/2024 - 15:59\nListo, logré acomodar mi css, armé el estilo bookie.toml, disponible en mi repo :) (Redacción -666 :p)\nAhora a hacer el deploy de github-pages\n02/06/2024 - 18:30\nListo el deploy de github-pages, muy importante no hay que ejecutar el deploy en la branch main, porque\nte va a sobre-escribir todo, ya sé que para algunxs es OBVIO, pero para personas que estan aprendiendo\nsobre la marcha (como yo, y mis amigos imaginarios que leen este blog ahre), es algo que no es tan obvio,\nademás de que no hay un cheatsheet conceptual que explique CADA cosa que existe, es prueba y error, ahora\na seguir con el install.sh y con el sistema (Cabe destacar qeu en el medio webié, hice housekeeping y\ntoqué guitarra como 1 hora)\n02/06/2024 - 20:33\nTerminé el install.sh pero ahora quiero asegurarme de tener todos mis dotfiles configurados, por ahora tengo\nla terminal (y Xresources por consecuencia), nvim (a confirmar...), newsboat,\n.bashrc y no sé que mas...\n02/06/2024 - 20:58\nMe falta hacer el script de backup y ya estoy.\n03/06/2024 - 00:42\nRenegué un montón con el tar para que me acomode multiples directorios en un solo gzip. Ya ahora tengo que dormir para trabajar mañana, no alcanzaron 3 días, que proceso arduo xD\n03/06/2024 - 21:13\nTerminé de trabajar a las 17, pero estuve descansando y escribiendo otro artículo, ahora voy a seguir haciendo el backup, pero antes modificaré la polybar, realmente quiero que matcheen los colores...\nlo mejor de esto es que después tengo que hacerlo con mi pc personal c:\n03/06/2024 - 22:22\nTerminé de acomodar la branch work, ahora voy a acomodar los dotfiles globales\n\n/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\n/etc/lightdm/slick-greeter.conf\n/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc\n/etc/vconsole.conf\n/usr/share/backgrounds/greeter-background.jpg\n\n04/06/2024 - 00:27\nListo los archivos, también modifiqué el script backup.sh y agregué el sudo cp .globdotfiles/* / al install.sh.
